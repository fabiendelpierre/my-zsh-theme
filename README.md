# My theme for oh-my-zsh

This is a copy of the official [kolo theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#kolo) with a tweaked prompt. I added two elements:

- A question mark at the start that displays in green when `$?` returns 0, and red when it returns anything other than 0.
- The short hostname in red.

Preview:
